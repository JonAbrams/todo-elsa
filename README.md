# Todo App (Elsa Example)

This is a simple todo app written with React and [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to demonstrate the [Elsa
babel plugin](https://github.com/JonAbrams/elsa).

There are two commits. The first commit is the todo app without Elsa. The second commit is with Elsa.

Look at the second commit to see how awesome Elsa is to use :D
